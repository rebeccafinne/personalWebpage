        <p>My name is <b>Rebecca Finne</b>, I'm 23 years old and I'm a Software engineering student currently studying my master in
          Interaction Design at Chalmers University of Technology, in Gothenburg Sweden. I plan for my studies to be
          finished in the spring of 2020.
          <br> <br> What I dream about in my future job is to be able to, in some way,
           make a difference. It could be anything to end poverty to an individual having
            an easier everyday life though any product that I have been a part of creating and developing.
             With my academical background this will be possible for me, by together with a team develop a great product.</p>
